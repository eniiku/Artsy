# Artsy
A photo gallery that serves creators &amp; collectors of art and photography generally.

I brought this Figma Design to live building an e-commerce web application that incorporates the latest web technologies and features advanced functionalities such as product filtering, secure payment integration, and personalized user accounts. 

This website also integrates Stripe payment processing for artwork purchases. Users can browse artworks, view detailed information about an artwork, add artworks of choice to cart, save favorites and create accounts to track purchases and save favorites. 

The design focuses on seamless user experience, smooth navigation and visually appealing layouts that adapt flawlessly to different screen sizes, fast loading times and optimized performance. Ensuring an intuitive browsing experience from the landing page to the checkout process.
 
Mobile optimization ensures consistent functionality across devices, while the robust and scalable architecture supports growing traffic and expanding product catalogs. Security is a top priority, with encryption, secure authentication, and data protection measures in place.
